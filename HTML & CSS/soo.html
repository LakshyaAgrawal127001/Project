        <h2>Indian Tyre Industry</h2>
        <p>The Indian Tyre Industry is an integral part of the Auto Sector –
            It contributes to ~3% of the manufacturing .
            GDP of India and ~0.5% of the total GDP directly.
            So, let’s understand the dynamics of the Tyre Industry in India. <br></p>

        <p>Indian tyre industry has almost doubled from ~Rs 30,000 crores in 2010-11 to ~Rs 59,500 crores in 2017-18
            of which 90-95% came from the domestic markets. The top three companies – MRF, Apollo Tyres and JK
            Tyres have ~60% of the market share in terms of revenue. In terms of segmentation tyres can be
            divided in two ways – based on end market and based on product.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong> Maintain proper inflation pressure in your tyres </strong><br><br>
            Proper inflation pressure is necessary in giving you the best tyre performance, safety, and fuel
            economy. Remember to frequently (at least once a month) check your tyres (when they are cool) with
            an accurate tyre pressure gauge.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong> Maintain inflation pressure at the recommended level</strong><br> <br>
            The recommended level can be found on the vehicle placard or in your vehicle’s owner’s manual.
            Maintaining proper inflation pressure is the single most important thing you can do to help your tyres
            last longer and stay durable.

            Under inflation is the leading cause of irrepairable tyre damage and may result in severe cracking and
            subsequent air loss. It reduces load capacity, allows excessive sidewall flexing, and increases
            rolling resistance, resulting in heat and mechanical damage.

            Over inflation increases stiffness that may cause an uncomfortable driving experience and generate
            unwanted vehicle vibration. It also increases the chances of impact damage.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong> Don’t spin your tyres excessively </strong> <br><br>
            Avoid excessive tyre spinning when your vehicle is stuck in snow, ice, mud or sand. This may cause tyre
            over-heating and irrepairable damage. Use a gentle backward and forward rocking motion to free your
            vehicle. Never stand near or behind a tyre spinning at high speeds, for example, while attempting
            to push a vehicle that’s stuck or when an on-car spin balance machine is in use.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Check your tyres for wear</strong><br><br>
            Always remove tyres from service when they reach 1.6mm remaining in tread depth. All new tyres have
            tread wear indicators that appears as smooth banks in the tread grooves when they wear to 1.6mm
            level. Wet weather accidents may occur from skidding on bald or nearly bald tyres. Excessively worn
            tyres are also more likely to suffer punctures.
        </p>
        <p>
            You most probably know the basics about the rubber feet for your car. You buy them from specialist
            shops, they’re commonly filled with air that slowly leaks through the sidewall/valve and they
            gradually wear down. Like everything though I’m sure there are a few things that may surprise you
            about tyres. Here’s a list of 10 interesting tyre facts that are not common knowledge outside the
            tyre enthusiast community.</p>

                <h3>Car tyres are naturally white</h3>
                <p>The natural colour of rubber is white, therefore tyre’s if left in their natural state would be
                    white. Why are they black? The black originally came as a byproduct of adding carbon to
                    strengthen the tyre. This was later replaced by silica for the majority of modern tyre
                    production. The colour black has remained constant for aesthetic reasons like being able to
                    withstand dirt and the colour complementing any colour car.</p>

                <h3>Tyres can be recycled into a variety of products/materials.</h3>
                <p>Tyres are currently recycled into more than 110 products. This is a great initiative and is
                    decreasing the quantity of scrap rubber ending up in landfills. Common uses for recycled
                    tyres around the world are roading, artificial turf and playground mats</p>

                <h3>Where did the name derive from? The word tyre or tire originated from 'attire' as the
                    product was seen as clothing for the wheel</h3>
                <p>Commonly spelt as ‘tire’ in America, in New Zealand we typically use tyre which wasn’t around
                    until the 19th century. ‘Tyre’ over the course of the 20th century became established as
                    standard British spelling.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>The world's biggest production tyre weighs over 5.5 tonnes and is over 4.2 metres tall</h3>
                <p>Titan Tyre created these monster tyre and wheel assemblies (pictured below). The tyres were first
                    shipped to Canada’s oil sands for use in mining applications. They now are being used all
                    over the world for machinery at large mining operations.</p>

                <h3>Tyres have the date they were produced on the sidewall - it's called a dot code</h3>
                <p>Pictured here the dot code is a four digit number with the first two indicating the week in the
                    year they were produced and the last two specifying the year. These are important to note,
                    especially when purchasing or using second-hand tyres.</p>

                <h3>Run-flat tyres have the ability to work for a limited time even with no air.</h3>
                <p>Reinforced sidewalls on run-flat tyres give them the capability of travelling without any air in
                    the tyre. This eliminates the need for an emergency roadside repair. Although once
                    punctured it’s not advised to repair a run-flat tyre as the structural integrity is
                    compromised, it’s recommended to replace in this case.</p>
